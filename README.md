# Logic-Design---Magic-Box
This project serves as an opportunity to apply and integrate all the techniques and skills acquired throughout the semester in logic design. Provides a practical implementation of theoretical concepts that reinforces the principles of Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential logic, state machines, and circuit optimization.

This project presents the design and implementation of a Logic-Controlled Board, a dynamic switching system where switches are used to activate LEDs of colors red, green, blue, and yellow. Initially, each switch is mapped to a lamp of the same color, but the system reconfigures the LEDs' activation based on the last switch turned off, creating an illusion of a magic switch box. Users can rearrange switch caps and lamp positions while maintaining correct color-to-switch mapping. The user might not understand the logic behind the circuit as it would appear as controlled by the magician. In fact, the choice of behavior is limited and made depending on the states following a certain logic.

The system employs digital logic circuits, memory elements, and finite state machines (FSMs) to track switch states and adjust lamp behavior in real time. This project demonstrates the application of sequential logic design in creating adaptable and interactive systems. The principles explored can be extended to real-world applications such as elevator controls, vending machines, traffic light systems, and interactive digital games, bringing together theoretical concepts and integrating them with practical solutions. Through this implementation, the report highlights the versatility of logic design in mimicking and enhancing everyday digital systems. The Logic-Controlled Board is a dynamic switching system designed to create an engaging illusion where lamps respond intelligently based on the last switch turned off. To get to a fully functional implementation of the Logic Controlled Board, extended research was conducted to understand the behavior of the system. To be able to translate our logic into a physical prototype, we started by designing a state machine responsible of dividing logical operations corresponding to the required operation. The states depend on the conditions of each expected outcome. We then proceeded by getting the equations for each of our chosen outputs based on the corresponding inputs. This was done using a Karnaugh Map software. We then simplified the corresponding equations in a way that allowed us to reuse combinations and avoid the excessive use of logical gates. To ensure our design was correct, we implemented the derived equations on Altera Quartus II software and obtained successful results. The next step was testing our implementation on the Virtual Breadboard to set up a plan that allowed us to avoid having a messy physical implementation. After the physical implementation on a breadboard and the separate testing of our circuits, we joined the entire system and made sure again of the results obtained.
